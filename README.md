# Google-Search-Automation

This script takes a search query and a number of results from the user. It then performs a Google search for the given query and opens each of the top search results (up to the specified number) in separate tabs in the default web browser. The script is useful for quickly opening several top search results for a given query without manually entering the query into a web browser.

Users should be aware that automated querying of Google Search is against Google's Terms of Service. Excessive use of this script may lead to your IP being blocked by Google. Use this script responsibly and at your own risk.
